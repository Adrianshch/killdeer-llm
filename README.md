Fine tuning is a better choice because we are not dealing with dynamic data and we will benefit from speed and reduced size of the model and cutoff is not a concern for us.

Ideas:
1. AITA LLM (easier)
2. Anti-polarization LLM


It looks like AWS Bedrock allows you to create a knowledge base (vector storage) and do fine-tuning. There is also something called AWS Lex that allows you to create a chatbot using the 
knowledge base. Unfortunately, it does cost a small amount of money (something like .00025 per use).
